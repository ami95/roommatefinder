# roommatefinder
This is a Django Project.
In order to run it, you will have to install Django.
(I recommend 1.11.8, because the filter application might not be compatible with other versions)
It's supposed to help people find their perfect roommates :)


How to run it:
After you have installed Django 1.11.8, go into the terminal, switch to the project directory, in the same folder where manage.py is. 
Then type the following command: python manage.py runserver
Then go to your browser and type this address: http://127.0.0.1:8000/signup/
